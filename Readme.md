# 🔨 Building A Basic Reusable Dynamic Comment Component With State 🛠

### Project Description: 
using forms and adding elements to the page with JavaScript to create a comment form. coordinating this using a state manager: a tool that controls how an application is displayed based on a given context. Changing the context, in this case adding a comment in the form, should change the application, in this case display a new comment on the page.

### Task: 
Update the page to display an image and add a comment form. The comment form should include:

- A name, email address, and large body input
- A checkbox to agree to have the comment posted
- A submit button
- All three comment fields should be required and be valid before being submitted
- Comments should be managed by a ***state manager***; Whenever a new comment is added, it should trigger the state manager that then updates the displayed comments on the site


### What was done to complete task: 
- Created functionality to take user input with a form 
- Used state to control the comments being posted 
- Created User interface design using **Figma** 
- Implemented design using DOM and CSS
